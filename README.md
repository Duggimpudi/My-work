# My-work
The data set(Mental Health Data) was downloaded from Kaggle for analysis.
There is a .txt file (Mental Health data set- SQL queries) which contains SQL queries - I used SQL to analyse the data.
There is also an Excel file which contains 3 sheets
  1. **Mental Health Dataset** - The original data set downloaded from Kaggle
  2. **List of Countries & Vlookup** - This is where I got the list of all countries to check against the dataset using Vlookup and match functions
  3. **Pivots and graphs** - I created a couple of pivot tables and visual representation of the findings from the dataset.
